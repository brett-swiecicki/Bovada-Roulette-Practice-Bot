Avoiding Detection:
	Randomize time between clicks
	Randomize click location
	Limit hours per day
	Put in sporadic breaks with sporadic durations
	Any CAPTCHA or other bot detection mechanism will need to be responded to manually ASAP
	If the check box "I'm not a robot" pops up, then the important thing is what the mouse does before checking the box.
	See if it is possible to change the IP frequently.

Detection Methods:
	User-agent string
	HTTP header signature
	Rate Limiting
	CAPTCHA
	JavaScript validation
	Honeypot traps
